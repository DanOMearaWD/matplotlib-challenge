This project contains three files: main.ipynb, where I wrote code and conducted analysis, and two data files, Mouse_metadata.csv and Study_results.csv, which are located inside the data folder.

In this project, I analyzed data from two sources: Mouse_metadata.csv and Study_results.csv. After cleaning and preparing the data, I created various visualizations, including bar charts, pie charts, box plots, line plots, and a scatter plot with a regression line. These visualizations led to key conclusions: Infubinol and Ceftamin had the highest median final tumor volumes, at least 1.5 times greater than those of Capomulin and Ramicane. Additionally, there was a strong correlation between average tumor volume and mouse weight in the Capomulin regimen; as weight increased, the average tumor volume also rose steadily.
