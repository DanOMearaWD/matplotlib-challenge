# Matplotlib Challenge

This project contains three files:
- **main.ipynb**: The Jupyter notebook where I wrote code and conducted analysis.
- **Mouse_metadata.csv**: Data file containing metadata about the mice.
- **Study_results.csv**: Data file with study results, located inside the **data** folder.

## Project Overview

In this project, I analyzed data from two sources: **Mouse_metadata.csv** and **Study_results.csv**. After cleaning and preparing the data, I created various visualizations, including:

- Bar charts
- Pie charts
- Box plots
- Line plots
- Scatter plot with a regression line

## Key Findings

The visualizations led to several key conclusions:

- **Infubinol** and **Ceftamin** had the highest median final tumor volumes, at least 1.5 times greater than those of **Capomulin** and **Ramicane**.
- There was a strong correlation between average tumor volume and mouse weight in the **Capomulin** regimen; as weight increased, the average tumor volume also rose steadily.
